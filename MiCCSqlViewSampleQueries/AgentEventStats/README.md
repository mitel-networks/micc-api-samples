# Agent Event SQL Views

| SQL View | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|[AgentEventsByPeriod.sql](https://github.com/mitel-networks/micc-api-samples/blob/master/MiCCSqlViewSampleQueries/AgentEventStats/AgentEventsByPeriod.sql) | Agent Events By Period Example: The Agent Events by Period example returns Agent Events by Period information. This example demonstrates how to calculate an average using integer math and avoid dividing by zero. It also demonstrates how to convert durations into readable strings. <br> <br> *NOTE: The collected data is aggregated by period so that one line of data is generated for each period. Periods that do not contain any data will not appear in the output.*  |
| [AgentGroupEventByAgent.sql](https://github.com/mitel-networks/micc-api-samples/blob/master/MiCCSqlViewSampleQueries/AgentEventStats/AgentGroupEventByAgent.sql)  | Agent Group Event by Agent Example: The Agent Group Event by Agent example returns Agent Group Event by Agent information. To return a result set on a specific agent group, replace ‘201’ in groups.Reporting = ‘201’ with the reporting number of the agent group you want to report on.<br> <br> *NOTE: The collected data is aggregated by agent so that one line of data is generated for each agent. Agents that do not contain any data will not appear in the output.* |
| [AgentGroupEventByDayOfMonth.sql](https://github.com/mitel-networks/micc-api-samples/blob/master/MiCCSqlViewSampleQueries/AgentEventStats/AgentGroupEventByDayOfMonth.sql) | Agent Group Event by Day of Month Example: The Agent Group Event by Day of Month example returns Agent Group Event by Day of Month information. The Agent Group Event by Day of Month example demonstrates how to convert durations into readable strings. To return a result set on a specific agent group, replace ‘201’ in groups.Reporting = ‘201’ with the reporting number of the agent group you want to report on.<br> <br> *NOTE: The collected data is aggregated by day of month so that one line of data is generated for each day of the month. Days that do not contain any data will not appear in the output.*  |
| [AgentGroupEventByDayOfWeek.sql](https://github.com/mitel-networks/micc-api-samples/blob/master/MiCCSqlViewSampleQueries/AgentEventStats/AgentGroupEventByDayOfWeek.sql) | Agent Group Event by Day of Week Example: The Agent Group Event by Day of Week example returns Agent Group Event by Day of Week information. This example demonstrates how to calculate an average using real numbers and avoid dividing by zero. It also demonstrates how to convert durations into readable strings. To return a result set on a specific agent group, replace ‘1’ in groups.Reporting = ‘201’ with the reporting number of the agent group you want to report on.<br> <br> *NOTE: The collected data is aggregated by day of week so that one line of data is generated for each day of the week. Days that do not contain any data will not appear in the output.*  |
| [AgentGroupEventByMonth.sql](https://github.com/mitel-networks/micc-api-samples/blob/master/MiCCSqlViewSampleQueries/AgentEventStats/AgentGroupEventByMonth.sql)  | Agent Group Event by Month Example: The Agent Group Event by Month example returns Agent Group Event by Month information. This example demonstrates how to convert durations into readable strings. To return a result set on a specific agent group, replace ‘201’ in groups.Reporting = ‘201’ with the reporting number of the agent group you want to report on. <br> <br> *NOTE: The collected data is aggregated by month so that one line of data is generated for each month. Months that do not contain any data will not appear in the output.*  |
| [AgentGroupEventByPeriod.sql](https://github.com/mitel-networks/micc-api-samples/blob/master/MiCCSqlViewSampleQueries/AgentEventStats/AgentGroupEventByPeriod.sql)  | Agent Group Event by Period Example: The Agent Group Event by Period example returns a result set equivalent to the Agent Group Event by Period report. |
